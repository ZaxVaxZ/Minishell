heredoc issues:
	$$USER expected behaviour: print the result of the variable $$ and then print USER

--track-fds=yes --tool=memcheck --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --track-children=yes

valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --suppressions=readline.supp --trace-children=yes --track-fds=yes ./bin/minishell

echo hi (<<a ls) ->prints hi and then proceeds to heredoc. after that, it then executs the ls command (NOT FIXED)
parenthesis right after a command are not being treated as illegal
echo hi > $ksjflsdj (redirect to a variable that doesn't exist in the environment) (LOL)
moving structs to their own header file (DONE)

sleep 2; echo hi: bad file descriptor
heredoc sigint segfaulting
heredoc piped with another heredoc: when interupting, pointer being fered was not allocated

when ctrl + c with a line in the prompt, the history sometimes bugs and doesn't scroll up
