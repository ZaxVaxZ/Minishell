heredoc issues:
	$$USER expected behaviour: print the result of the variable $$ and then print USER

echo hi > $ksjflsdj (redirect to a variable that doesn't exist in the environment) (LOL)
command followed by open paranthesis -> allows execution when it should give illegal syntax error

sleep 2; echo hi: bad file descriptor
heredoc followed by or/and and then siginterrupted: bad file descriptor
<<a ls <setup.sh: bad file descriptor
<<a echo hi: not heredocing

when ctrl + c with a line in the prompt, the history sometimes bugs and doesn't scroll up

cat | ls: cat doesn't close properly (FIXED)
parenthesis right after a command are not being treated as illegal (FIXED)
echo hi (<<a ls) ->prints hi and then proceeds to heredoc. after that, it then executs the ls command (FIXED)
heredoc sigint segfaulting (FIXED)
heredoc piped with another heredoc: when interupting, pointer being fered was not allocated (FIXED)
moving structs to their own header file (FIXED)
