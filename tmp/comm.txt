command -> <multiple-env-var-assign?> (<infile-redir> <infile>)? <command (not needed if infile)> <arguments?> <outfile-redir?> <outfile?> <control-operator>
returns: exit-status OR 128+signal
parse error is exit 258?




To Do List:
Minishell built-ins
"$" (dollar sign in double quotes handling what's after it)
clean up and double check all cases of $
better handle assign parsing:
	parse variable name up until equals (same code as current)
	after that parse until space or tab, BUT when finding SQ or DQ, parse that
