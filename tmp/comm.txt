Figure out how to manipulate env
Add ? to env as a variable

For env:
create a linked list for the env which will consist of a key value pair
copy the queues functions for it lol
create a function to convert the linked list into a double array for execve uwu

====================================================================================================================================================================

Execute the command
If the after type of the command is a pipe, execute the command into a pipe and pipe the output to the next command
	store an array of fds
If the after type is &&, execute the command;
	if the execution fails, don't execute the next command
If the after type is ||, execute the command
	if the execution fails, execute the next command

export and unset need to work on each parameter
they need to print a msg for each invalid identifier
exit needs to work
echo retested
pwd retested
DO CD


His work is very clean and organized, and it shows a lot of care and interest and time spent on the code. But it's not just looks, the code works perfectly great and is accurate to what is asked for. He fully explained the concepts and showed a lot of understanding and comprehension, and that he dived into C++ and cared about learning it well. I even asked him about a case from outside the project and he answered it accurately, showing that he fully understands how everything works. Great work!!
