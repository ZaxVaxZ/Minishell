fix heredoc delimiter parsing
don't allow parse tokens after illegal
heredoc taking input from duped pipe (FIXED)
echo hi > $ksjflsdj (redirect to a variable that doesn't exist in the environment)
heredoc with an outfile
capitalization of commands (use strcasecmp to strcmp the commands rather than strncmp)
ls && <<a cat | <<b cat SEGV on unknown address
echo hi <<a ls (should heredoc but not heredoc-ing)
ls && (echo hi) | (echo hello) -> quitting the program for some reason
ls && echo hi | echo hello -> command with and followed by piped command suddenly exits
echo hi (<<a ls) ->prints hi and then proceeds to heredoc. after that, it then executs the ls command
parenthesis right after a command are not being treated as illegal
when ctrl + c with a line in the prompt, the history sometimes bugs and doesn't scroll up
