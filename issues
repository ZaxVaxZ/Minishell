fix heredoc delimiter parsing
don't allow parse tokens after illegal
heredoc taking input from duped pipe (FIXED)
echo hi > $ksjflsdj (redirect to a variable that doesn't exist in the environment)
heredoc with an outfile
capitalization of commands (use strcasecmp to strcmp the commands rather than strncmp)
ls && <<a cat | <<b cat SEGV on unknown address
echo hi <<a ls (should heredoc but not heredoc-ing)
